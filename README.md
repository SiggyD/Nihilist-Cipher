# Nihilist-Cipher
A python implementation of the nihilist ciper.
Learn about it here! -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilist_cipher
This program provides functionality of creating a polybius square for a given key.
It also has the ability to encrypt and decrypt nihilist ciphers. The cipher is fairly simple to encrypt, even by hand.
As with most ciphers, (key)size matters, don't expect the cipher to stand up to a moderately motivated Adversary.
Or, even lazy one with an ability to google.
